# Persian RAG System with Langchain and LLAMA 2
This repository implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Persian documents using Langchain and LLAMA 2. RAG systems are a type of text generation model that combines retrieval and generation techniques to improve the quality of generated text.

## Background
LLMs (Large Language Models) are often prone to hallucinations, which are factual errors that are generated by the model due to its lack of understanding of the real world. RAG systems can help to mitigate this problem by retrieving relevant documents that can be used to guide the generation process.
